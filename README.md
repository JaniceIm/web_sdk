## <a id="basics">Basics

This SDK can be used to track installs, sessions and events. Simply add the Adjust JS SDK to your web app.

### <a id="implementation">Implementation

There are a few things to keep in mind while implementing the JS SDK:

- As the SDK will not be able to read the platform, it is necessary that you either pass dynamically or hardcode it in the `os_name` parameter.
- If your app isn't able to access or pass advertising IDs such as `gps_adid` or `idfa` or `win_adid` into their respective parameters, it is recommended that you pass a similarly built UUID for iOS and Android and a similar device ID to `win_adid` for Windows. These IDs would need to be generated by your app.

### <a id="recommendations">Recommendations

There are two ways to differentiate users coming from native apps to users coming from web apps if you are not running ad campaigns for your web apps:

- Create new app(s) in your Adjust dashboard for your web app, pick one of the supported platforms during the creation and use this app token in the Adjust SDK to initialise it. All traffic from your app will then be labelled under the `Organic` tracker in your Adjust dashboard.
- Use one of your pre-existing app and hardcode a pre-installed tracker token in the Adjust SDK. All traffic from your app will then be labelled under the hardcoded tracker in your Adjust dashboard.

This is what the implementation would be:

```js
window.Adjust = function(app_token, environment, os_name) {
    this.trackSession = function(device_ids) {
        var params = cloneObj(device_ids);
        params["app_token"] = app_token;
        params["os_name"]   = os_name;
        params["environment"] = environment;
        params["default_tracker"] = "abc123";

        sendRequest("GET", "https://app.adjust.com/session?" + encodeQueryString(params));
    };

    this.trackEvent = function(event_token, device_ids) {
        var params = cloneObj(device_ids);
        params["app_token"]   = app_token;
        params["event_token"] = event_token;
        params["os_name"]     = os_name;
        params["environment"] = environment;

        sendRequest("GET", "https://app.adjust.com/event?" + encodeQueryString(params));
    };
}
```
